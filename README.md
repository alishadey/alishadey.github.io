# Hi, Iâ€™m Alisha Dey ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my little corner of the internet! This website shares some of my passions and past projects. Thanks for taking a look!

## Live

- GitHub Pages: https://alishadey.github.io/

## What youâ€™ll find here

- A friendly home page with a smiling face (hi!) and a quick hello.
- A few project stories Iâ€™m proud of:
  - Beyond the Playground â€” designing for children in public spaces.
  - KWMUnity â€” collaboration, community, and creative problemâ€‘solving.
  - Donâ€™t Buy It â€” an interactive museum exhibit about sustainable consumption.
- Clean, legible typography and calm colours that let the work shine.

## Explore

Open the site and click around:
- Home: `index.html`
- Case studies: `ki_thesis.html`, `kwmunity.html`, `museum.html`

Thereâ€™s even an interactive walkthrough on the museum page if you like to explore exhibits from your couch.

## A few design notes

I care a lot about readability and accessibility. Youâ€™ll see generous spacing, crisp type, and simple layouts. Images can be clicked to enlarge (because details matter), and captions help tell the story.

## Say hello

- Email: alisha.dey@mail.utoronto.ca
- LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/alishadey

If youâ€™re into people-centred design, city spaces, or delightful little details in everyday life, weâ€™ll get along.
