      <div class="portfolio-subtitle">Why are most public spaces designed for adults, while children are often an afterthought?</div>
      <div class='portfolio-heading'>Purpose</div>
      <div class='portfolio-body'>Don’t Buy It was an interactive museum exhibit developed over eight months during my third year in the Knowledge Integration program at the University of Waterloo. Created as part of a team of five for our third year capstone course, the exhibit explored the contradictions of sustainable consumption. As the Design Lead and a member of the build team, I oversaw visual storytelling, spatial layout, and fabrication elements while supporting collaborative content development. The exhibit invited visitors to question how environmental values are often co-opted by consumer culture through greenwashing and trend-based marketing.

      <div class="portfolio-heading">Goals</div>
      
      
      <div class="portfolio-body">
         <ul><li>Unpack the disconnect between sustainability messaging and consumer behaviour</li>
        <li>Raise awareness of greenwashing and deceptive branding strategies</li>
        <li>Empower visitors to reflect on their own consumption habits and environmental beliefs</li>
</div>
      <div class='portfolio-heading'>Methods</div>
      <div class='portfolio-body'>We began with deep research into marketing psychology, the rise of “eco-friendly” branding, and the lifecycle impacts of everyday products like water bottles and tote bags. The exhibit’s narrative structure was designed as a guided experience: visitors encountered visual overload, were prompted to question their assumptions, and exited through a reflective zone that invited commitment to more conscious consumption. We used multimedia, hands-on engagement, and social media examples to anchor abstract ideas in daily realities. 

      <div class='portfolio-heading'>Creative Process</div>
      <div class='portfolio-body'>
       <div class='portfolio-body'>My contributions were focused on ensuring the spatial and visual cohesion of the exhibit. I led the design of interactive panels and displays, working closely with teammates to transform complex research into accessible storytelling. We incorporated real-world objects (e.g., an evolution of reusable water bottles) and a social media loop to immerse visitors in the tension between environmental concern and consumerist habits. The exhibit was iterative, shaped by feedback from peers and faculty throughout its development.
