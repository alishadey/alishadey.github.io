    <div class='portfolio-title'>Beyond the Playground: Integrating Children Into Public Spaces</div>
	<img src='assets/ki_thesis.png'>

    <div class='portfolio-heading'>Purpose:</div>
    <div class='portfolio-body'>Why are most public spaces designed for adults, while children are often an afterthought? This question guided my fourth-year senior research thesis at the University of Waterloo. I led this independent research project to explore how airports, hospitals, and retail spaces can be made more inclusive for children aged 4-6. The goal was to move beyond traditional spaces built for children as an effort to recognize their potential from a young age.</div>

    <div class='portfolio-heading'>Goals:</div>
    <div class='portfolio-body'>
      <ul>
        <li>Reimagine public spaces as intergenerational environments</li>
        <li>Promote independence, confidence, and learning opportunities for young children</li>
        <li>Challenge the notion that play is the only way to include children in design</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class='portfolio-heading'>Approach:</div>
    <div class='portfolio-body'>This project combined methods from design research, environmental psychology, and developmental theory. I conducted field observations at five public sites (Pearson Airport, Fort Lauderdale Airport, Grand River Hospital, Credit Valley Hospital, and Conestoga Mall), supported by a comprehensive literature review in child developmental psychology, and environmental design. I also developed an evaluative framework based on three key criteria: discovery, autonomy, and emotional support.</div>

    <div class='portfolio-heading'>Interventions</div>
    <div class='portfolio-subheading'>Mini Explorers Passport (Airports)</div>
    <div class='portfolio-body'>A discovery-based reward system that encourages children to explore airport features and cultural displays independently. This includes interactive stamp stations and visual signage guide participation.</div>

    <img src='assets/ki_thesis_assets/after_airport.png'>
    <div class='portfolio-image-caption-subheading'>After</div>


    <div class='portfolio-subheading'>Junior Med Explorers Station (Hospitals)</div>
    <div class='portfolio-body'>A tactile, kiosk-based learning station that introduces children to basic hospital roles, tools, and procedures through drawings, videos, and sensory elements.</div>

    <div class='portfolio-image-caption-subheading'>After</div>


    <div class='portfolio-subheading'>Retail Discovery Zones</div>
    <div class='portfolio-body'>Hands-on, fabric-based stations where children can learn about textures, colours, and garment-making. Includes outfit building and simple educational touchpoints about materials.</div>

    <div class='portfolio-heading'>Challenges:</div>
    <div class='portfolio-body'>One of the main challenges of this project was defining a clear scope. I chose to focus on children aged 4-6 to narrow the design context meaningfully, but this decision required significant upfront research to justify developmentally appropriate design features. Another difficulty was choosing which environments to focus on. While I was ambitious in tackling three different public settings, I recognize that the project may have gained added depth and polish had I concentrated on just one space. Balancing breadth with clarity was an ongoing consideration and challenge.</div>

    <div class='portfolio-heading'>Impact and Outcome:</div>
    <div class='portfolio-body'>I presented this project at the 2025 Knowledge Integration Symposium, where I received valuable feedback from peers, faculty, and community members. This projects contributed to growing conversations around child-friendly public design and offered a framework that bridges design thinking, user-experience, and developmental psychology.</div>
